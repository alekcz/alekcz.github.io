I've had the privilege of giving a few talks across the globe. Traveling around the world giving talks is inspiring, eye-opening and humbling. It is particulary humbling to realise that there are people from all over who were interested in what I had to say and enjoyed my talk. It makes me glad to be able to give back to the community by sharing what I've learned.
