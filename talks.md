I've had the privilege of giving a few talks across the globe. Traveling around the world giving talks is inspiring, eye-opening and humbling. It is particulary humbling to realise that there are people from all over the world who are interested in what I have to say and enjoy my talks. It makes me glad to be able to give back to the community by sharing what I've learned.
