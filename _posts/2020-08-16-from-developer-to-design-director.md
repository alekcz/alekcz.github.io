Circa 2016 I started my journey into the land of experience design. The journey from frontend dev to design director has been one heck of adventure. I've been extremely lucky to have had some excellent mentors, managers, and sponsors along the way. This post is not about them, but rather the books that accompanied me along the way. 

It all started when Phil threw down the gauntlet.

Needless to say, I didn't finish them all in a year. And I still haven't read them all. But it was the beginning of a great reading habit. If you're not a reader (or listener) yet, I can't recommend it enough. Here's a list of the books I've read on my journey. They've all been been quite value in my career and development. 


One last thing before the list. It's a long list and will take you longer to read than you expect. You won't remember everything you read. Some will be hard to read. You'll get tired of reading. And feel like you're not growing. All those things are okay. In the words of Josemaria Escriva: 

> *"Don't forget that, on earth, every big thing has had a small beginning. What is born big is monstrous and dies."*

Happy reading. Happy learning.
