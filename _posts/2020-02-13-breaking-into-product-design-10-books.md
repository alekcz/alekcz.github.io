Today we're debunking that myth. I've a lot over the last few years, partly from doing and partly from reading. 
Since sharing is caring, here is **Part 1 of 3** of the books that have supercharged my knowledge. 

## 10 Great books on Product Design

1. Zero to One
2. The Lean Startup
3. Predictably Irrational
4. Competing Against Luck
5. Thinking Fast and Slow
6. Hooked: How to Build Habit forming Products
7. Thinking in Bets
8. Inspired: How to Create Tech Product Customers Love
9. Hard Thing About Hard Things
10. Misbehaving
