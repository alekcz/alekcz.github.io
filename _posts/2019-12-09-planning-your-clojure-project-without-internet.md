There's something almost primal about the desire to make. 

Clojure's super power is wrangling data. And yours, well, your super power is thinking. 


The weird thing is that having dodgy internet connectivity often forces one to build the right habits.



### 1. Define the problem 


### 2. Look at multiple options


### 3. Mock the internet


### 4. Identify dependencies 


### 5. Find an oasis of internet. 


### 6. Find and install you dependencies


### Now what?
It's time to boot the REPL. But that's a story for another day. 


_May your build always pass._
