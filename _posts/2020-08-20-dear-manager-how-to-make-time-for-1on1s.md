Building healthy and effective teams is a core responsibility of a manager. 1on1s are an invaluable tool in doing this. 1on1s generally have three purposes:

1. To foster a healthy relationship between you and your report
2. To give the two of you time to discuss things in private 
3. To help you develop your reports through mentoring, coaching and feedback.

In the wise words of [Camille Fournier](https://twitter.com/skamille), author of The Manager's Path:
> "The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust. And trust, real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other. So, your manager will hopefully treat you like a human who has a life outside of work, and spend a few minutes talking about that life when you meet."

## What you need

<img src='/images/blog/1on1-2.png' width='250'>

1. **A list of your reports**   
You will need to have 1on1s with all your reports.  
1. **Your calendar for the last 3 months**    
You will need to understand the trends in your availability and you will need to block out time for your 1on1s.  
1. **Your phone**   
You can't remember everything so you'll need to set up reminders  
1. **Something to draw on**  
Tools and formatting can easily get in the way of thinking. Solving the problem on paper first yields better results.

## First, plan your time 
<img src='/images/blog/1on1-3.png' width='250'>

### Step 1: Analyse your availability
Look back at your calendar over the last 3 months. You're looking for the no-go zones. 

- Where do emergency meetings happen most often?
- Where do you feel most tired?
- Where are you liked to still be on your way if there are delays in your commute?
- Where are the scrum ceremonies?

Now that you've eliminated the horrible places for 1on1s you can move forward.

### Step 2: Build the required 1on1 slots into your calendar
You will need one 30 minute slot for each of your reports. 

- Start scheduling from the middle of the week outwards. Monday and Friday should not be used for 1on1s if possible.
- Generally speaking mornings are best. There is less time for your day to spiral. 
- Try avoid back to back slots where possible. More than two 1on1s in a row is unfair to both you and your direct reports.
- Select times that are likely to work from your team.
- Do not use the slots that where eliminated in Step 1. 

### Step 3: Set up mobile reminders 
For each 1on1 slot set up two reminders. One well before and the other 10 minutes before. Set up the reminders on the device you are most likely to have on your person during the selected time slots.

## Then, make your schedule

### Step 4: Select a collaborative tool 
Dropbox Paper is a really great tool for this. It is important that you use a tool that your team is comfortable using and all have access to. 

### Step 5: Understand the components of a 1on1 roster
A 1on1 roster is made up of 3 sections: Available times, Conversation Guide, Channels of communication. 

*Available Times*  
This section is built using the slots identified in Steps 1 and 2. This is where your reports can fill in their prefered slot. It is important that your reports can select their own time so that they can be held accountable for arriving on time. While you have chosen the times that work for you, you may have to adjust them based on the schedules of your reports. 

*Conversation Guide*  
1on1s can be unbelievably awkward at first. The awkwardness can discourage you and your report. To help fight against this, a conversation guide is useful. It allows you both to go into the conversation know what to expect. A conversation guide is particularly important for your remote reports, as the distance can amplify awkwardness.

*Channels of Communication*  
Face to face is undoubtedly the channel of communication. A prioritised list of the tools that your reports should use for 1on1s is important in case a face to face session is not possible. 

### Step 6: Study this example

### Step 7: Build you 1on1 roster
Build your roster using Steps 5 and 6 as a guideline and the template below. Customize the template structure, copy and tone so that it is appropriate for the people you manager.   

You can grab the template (Dropbox Paper) here: [1on1 Roster Template on Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/1on1-roster-for-Team-X--A6A273gDMqZd7JUd6E~0SF~bAg-BhRnIHiwmwBR11XpH5PVM)

### Step 8: Share your schedule with your team
Share your schedule with your team. Spend the next week or so reminding them to select a slot. Don't be disheartened if it take a while.

### Step 9: Keep to the schedule
It is very very import that you keep to the schedule. 1on1s give your reports the confidence that they have protected time with you. This goes a long way to creating a healthy and productive team.

## Lastly, change your mindset
<img src='/images/blog/1on1-5.png' width='250'>

Successful 1on1s require a mental shift in both you and your reports. Lead by example. 

- **1on1s are your responsibility.**   
Because of the power dynamic it is unjust to expect your report to drive your 1on1s.
- **Remember habit beats willpower every time.**    
Show up for your 1on1s every time. Even if you're late. Or can't make the full session. Build the habit. 
- **1on1s are not status meetings.**    
Making status meetings out of 1on1s will make them dreadfully boring, repetitive and unfulfilling. 
- **Respect the appointment.**    
If you can't make it, let your report know in advance, if not apologise afterwards and reschedule. 
- **Default to confidentiality.**    
A 1on1 is a safe space for your report, be upfront about what kind of things are not confidential. 
- **Default to candor.**    
1on1s are an opportunity to give feedback and get to know your report. Open and honest communication is critical.
- **Be positive.**    
Your attitude sets the tone. Your report should not pay the price for the difficult meeting you just came from. 
- **Take notes.**    
You won't remember everything from all your 1on1s and getting to know your reports is important, so take notes. 
- **This is hard.**    
You're going to make mistakes; that's okay, you'll get better. There will be awkward conversations; that's okay, healthy relationships can't be rushed.
